# Taskman
A toy application (task manager) written in Go.

Based on the problem [here](https://github.com/gophercises/task).

## Build
```go build -o bin/taskman```

## Run
```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT

# Add a task
bin/taskman add Buy bread and milk before the snowstorm

# List all tasks that haven't been done
bin/taskman list

# Mark the first listed task as "done"
bin/taskman do 1

# List all tasks marked "done"
bin/taskman list done

```

## TODO:
- add cleanup command to remove "done" tasks
- DRY up "done" and "list" code? Maybe into a single function?
